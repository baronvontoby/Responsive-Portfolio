            <p>Since I can remember I have had an interest and also an affinity for technology.  Not only have I enjoyed playing countless hours of
                video games, going all the way back to
                the original Oregon Trail and Sim City, but I have also had a thirst to understand how they worked.  It is 
                this thirst that has led me to the University of Minnesota's Coding Boot Camp.
            </p>
            <p>But enough about my passion for technology.  The real basis of this website is to introduce you to me as a person.  So here we go: <br>
                I was born and raised in Saint Paul Minnesota where I continue to reside with my wife Toni and son Giovanni.  Yes, if it wasn't
                obvious enough from our names, my wife and I are Italian.  Like any true Italian we love pasta, well any food really and we love life.  
                She was my biggest advocate to make the change and quit my job to take a three month coding boot camp.
            </p>
            <p>My wife is definitely the most important person in my life and a lot of that stems from our common shared interests.  We are 
                both die hard Disney fans.  We try to travel down to Orlando every other year and now with our first child here it is even
                more exciting and that much less of an excuse not to go. I honestly think every person out there is still a little bit of a kid at heart.  
                Also we are very big Harry Potter fans so it makes Orlando a 2 for 1 deal when we go.
            </p>
            <p>On top of my wife and I's enjoyment of Disney and Harry Potter we honestly love to travel internationally.  By the end of 2020
                we will have visited 4 countries in 4 years and we couldn't be more excited. Our next trip is to the Emerald Isle, which of 
                course is Ireland! 
            </p>
            <p>Finally the last few things I think anyone should know about me is that I truly have defined myself by these 
                three categories.  I am a very loyal person and sometimes loyal to a fault. I love to communicate with others.
                I am one of those friends that can pick up where we left off and just keep the conversation going. Finally I am a 
                builder.  My whole life I have always been intrigued by starting something from scratch and making it my own.  So that is me,
                not necessarily in a nutshell but at least a good enough overview you might have a better understanding.  All the best 
                to anyone who comes across this page and takes the time to read it.
